2.In a clean large mixing bowl, add finely chopped garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, dried rosemary, red chilli flakes, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper. Mix them all well.<br/>

3.Next we will roast the vegetables. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a heavy bottomed pan or a wok, add the sliced vegetable, sprinkle some salt and roast them until lightly softened. Turn off the heat.<br/>

4.Add paneer slices and roasted veggies to the marinade and gently toss them well, cover and keep it aside for 5 minutes.<br/>

5.Next, heat and grease the grill pan (if using cast iron grill pan, brush it with little olive oil).<br/>

6.Place the marinated paneer slices on the grill pan and grill it on high heat for 2 minutes on each side. Take out the grilled paneer from the pan and keep it aside in a bowl. <br/>

7.The next step is to assemble the Sandwich with Paneer & Roasted Vegetables.<br/>

8.Next, slice the submarine bread horizontally. Apply butter on both the halves of the bread. Toast  both the halves of the bread on same grill pan until slightly golden brown and crisp. Once the bread is toasted, remove from the heat.<br/>

9.Place the toasted bread on a flat surface.  Place a cheese slice on lower half of the bread and make an even layer of iceberg lettuce. Place the grilled vegetables and the grilled paneer pieces on the top.<br/>

10.Top it with dollops of mustard sauce and the remaining marinade from the bowl. Cover the sandwich with the other half of the bread and serve.
